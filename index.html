                <h1> About Me </h1>
                <p> I'm Henry kinyua also known as Karis as a nickname. I was born and currently living in
                    kenya in eastern Africa region. My hobbies
                    are swimming, hiking, cooking etc. I just finished my high school
                    some few years back and decided to enroll in BYU pathway worldwide
                    program since it offers reliable and affordable courses</p>

                    <h5>Official Kenyan Flag</h5>
                    <p>Nairobi is Kenyaâ€™s capital city. In addition to its urban core,
                        the city has Nairobi National Park, a large game reserve known for
                        breeding endangered black rhinos and home to giraffes, zebras and lions.
                        Next to it is a well-regarded elephant orphanage operated by the David
                        Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. Nairobi is also often used as a jumping-off
                        point for safari trips elsewhere in Kenya.</p>
